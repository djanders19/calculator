# Calculator

This project implements a simple browser-based calculator. It evaluates numbers in pairs,
for example 1 + 2 * 6 evaluates to __18__, not 13. In the future I hope to extend it to
handle a more user-friendly grammar supporting the order of operations we all know and love.
A basic description of how to do this can be found in Bjarne Stroustrup's book
Programming Principles and Practice if you want to have a crack at it.
